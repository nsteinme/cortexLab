# cortexLab
Shared Matlab code for the [Cortical Processing Laboratory](http://www.cortexlab.net) at UCL; may also be useful to others.

See also [phy](http://www.github.com/kwikteam/phy) for shared python code. 

Broken into "low level" code that is generic and agnostic about the nature of the input data, as well as "high level" code that is built for certain data types or input formats. The former is likely to be generally useful for data analysis, plotting, and neuroscience; the latter may be useful only for more specialized applications or even specific to the Cortex Lab.
